Full Disease Gene Mapping Pipeline

1. Simupop simulation using human genome as starting point.
	a. initial population from Hapmap data
		loadHapMap3.py
		selectMarkers.py
		-select hapmap populations
		-select chromosomes (by name)
		-select markers (number of markers + start, range, list of SNPs)
	b. expand population under selection
		-names of markers under selection
		-selection regime
	c. generate case/control datasets using a penetrance model
		-penetrance.py
		single gene
			alleles additive or multiplicative?
		multiple Gene
			genes and alleles additive/multiplicative?
		wild type risk?
		relative risk?
		number of cases
		number of controls
	d. remove monomorphic markers (and DPL?) from datasets
		remove_rare_snps.py
		remove_DPL.py
		
2. Generation of input datafiles for various disease mapping programs.
	a. simupop_formatr.py
		- names of programs
	b. marg_split.py (makes sliding windows)
	
3. Generation of script files for running programs on SGE cluster.
	a. program-specific options (number of ARGs, number of permutations, etc)
	b. SGE options (memory, number of machines)
	c. is it to be run as an "array"?
		program-specific array intstructions

4. Generation of script files for collecting results.
	a. based on the programs run: need to stitch windows back together?
	
5. Generation of pipeline-run INSTRUCTIONS.
